This package contains the `genes` dataset. It accompanies a workshop-style class that provides an
introduction to the emerging field of Data Science in R, including data
analysis and visualization, with a particular focus on its utility for
biological insight. This package also contains some utility functions related to protein analyses.

## Installation

You **cannot** yet install the released version of tidybiology from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("genes")
```

So in the meantime, use the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hirscheylab/genes")
```


## Example

This is how to take a `glimpse` into the genes dataset:

``` r
library(genes)
glimpse(genes)
```
